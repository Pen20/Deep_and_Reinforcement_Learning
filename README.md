# Deep and Reinforcement Learning
Deep learning and reinforcement learning are distinct but related concepts within the field of artificial intelligence.
## Reinforcement learning
 Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics—trial-and-error search and delayed reward—are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.

 The distinction between problems and solution methods is very important in reinforcement learning; failing to make this distinction is the source of many confusions.
We formalize the problem of reinforcement learning using ideas from dynamical systems theory, specifically, as the optimal control of incompletely-known Markov decision processes. Markov decision processes are intended to include three aspects—sensation, action, and goal—in the simplest possible forms without trivializing any of these aspects. Any method that is well suited to solving such problems is consider to be a reinforcement learning method.

## Deep learning
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that is made up of a neural network with three or more layers:

Input layer: Data enters through the input layer.

Hidden layers: Hidden layers process and transport data to other layers.

Output layer: The final result or prediction is made in the output layer.

Neural networks attempt to model human learning by digesting and analyzing massive amounts of information, also known as training data. They perform a given task with that data repeatedly, improving in accuracy each time. It's similar to the way we study and practice to improve skills.
